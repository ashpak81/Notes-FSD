# Data Structures

## Introduction

A **data structure** is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and used efficiently. Proper use of data structures can make programs run faster and use less memory.

## Types of Data Structures (Predefine DSA)

### 1. Array
An array is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements, each identified by at least one array index or key. All elements in an array are of the same type and memory size.

**Real-time scenarios:**
- **Database:** Used to store and retrieve data efficiently.
- **Lists and Schedules:** Represent to-do lists where each element corresponds to a task.
- **Game Development:** Used for levels, inventory items, characters, etc.

### 2. Stack
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. The element inserted last into the stack is the first one to be removed. Stacks can be implemented using arrays, linked lists, or other data structures.

**Real-time scenarios:**
- **Browser History:** Tracks visited pages.
- **Undo Operations:** In text editors and software.

### 3. Queue
A queue is a linear data structure that stores elements in First In First Out (FIFO) order. The first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed. Queues are typically implemented using linked lists or arrays.

**Real-time scenarios:**
- **Ticket Counter:** Manages people in line.
- **Traffic Management:** Controls the flow of traffic.

### 4. Linked List
A linked list is a linear data structure that stores a sequence of elements, called nodes, connected by pointers. Each node contains data and a reference to the next node. The first node is called the head and the last node is called the tail.

**Real-time scenarios:**
- **Music Playlist:** Manages songs in a sequence.
- **Train or Subway Cars:** Represents connected train cars.

### 5. Trees
A tree is a non-linear data structure that stores elements in a hierarchical manner. The topmost node is known as the root node. Each node contains data and can have multiple child nodes.

**Real-time scenarios:**
- **File System:** Organizes files and directories.

### 6. Hashtable, Hashset, and Hashmap
- **Hashtable:** Maps keys to values using a hash function.
- **Hashmap:** Similar to hashtable but allows iteration over keys and values.
- **Hashset:** Stores unique values using a hash table.

**Real-time scenarios:**
- **Database Indexing:** Efficiently searches and retrieves data.
- **DNS Resolution:** Maps domain names to IP addresses.

### 7. Graph
A graph is a collection of nodes connected by edges, used to represent relationships between different entities. Graph algorithms manipulate and analyze graphs, solving problems like finding the shortest path or detecting cycles.

**Real-time scenarios:**
- **Database Indexing:** Organizes data for quick retrieval.
- **DNS Resolution:** Manages the mapping of domain names to IP addresses.

By understanding and using these data structures appropriately, you can significantly improve the efficiency and performance of your programs.
