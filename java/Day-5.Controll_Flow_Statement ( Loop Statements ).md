# Loop 
- oops in Java is a feature used to execute a particular part of the program repeatedly if a given condition evaluates to be true.

## For Loop
  - or loops are the most common type of loop in Java. They are used to iterate over a collection of data, such as an array or a list.
  - Syntax
    ```
      for (initialization; condition; increment) {
            // code to be executed
        }
    ```
## While Loop
- While loops are used to execute a block of code as long as a condition is true.
- Syntax
  ```
    while (condition) {
      // code to be executed
    }
## Do While Loop
- The condition statement is evaluated before each iteration of the loop. If the condition is true, the code block is executed. The loop continues to iterate as long as the condition is true.
Do-while loops are similar to while.
- Syntax
  ```
      do {
        // code to be executed
        // update condition inside the loop
      } while (condition);
  ```
