# Operators And Expressions 
**Operators**

Operators are symbols used to perform operations on variables or values in programming languages.

**Expressions**

Expressions are combinations of operands, operators, values, variables, and methods.
Example:
```java
int a = 8; // Variable declaration.
int b = 6; // Variable declaration.
a + b; // Expression ('+' is called an operator and 'a' is called an operand).
```

## **Types of Expressions**

### 1. **Arithmetic Expressions:**
   - Arithmetic expressions are used to perform mathematical operations such as addition, multiplication, subtraction, etc.
   - Examples:
     ```java
     int result = 10 + 5;  // Addition.
     int difference = 10 - 5;  // Subtraction.
     int product = 10 * 5;  // Multiplication.
     int quotient = 10 / 5;  // Division.
     int remainder = 10 % 3;  // Modulus.
     ```

### 2. **Relational Expressions:**
   - Relational expressions are used to compare values and determine the relationship between them.
   - These expressions return a boolean value (true or false).
   - Examples:
     ```java
     boolean isEqual = (10 == 5);  // Equal to
     boolean isNotEqual = (10 != 5);  // Not equal to
     boolean isGreater = (10 > 5);  // Greater than
     boolean isLess = (10 < 5);  // Less than
     boolean isGreaterOrEqual = (10 >= 5);  // Greater than or equal to
     boolean isLessOrEqual = (10 <= 5);  // Less than or equal to
     ```

### 3. **Logical Expressions:**
   - Logical expressions are used to perform logical operations such as AND (&&), OR (||), and NOT (!).
   - Examples:
     ```java
     boolean condition1 = true;
     boolean condition2 = false;
     boolean resultAnd = (condition1 && condition2);  // Logical AND
     boolean resultOr = (condition1 || condition2);  // Logical OR
     boolean resultNot = !condition1;  // Logical NOT
     ```

### 4. **Assignment Expressions:**
   - Assignment expressions are used to assign a value to a variable.
   - Common assignment operators are =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=.
   - Examples:
     ```java
     int x = 10;  // Assignment.
     x += 5;  // Compound assignment (x = x + 5).
     ```
