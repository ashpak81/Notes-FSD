# Understanding Data, Databases, Information, and DBMS

## What is Data?

Data is nothing but facts and statistics stored or free flowing over a network. Generally, it's raw and unprocessed.

## What is Information?

Information is data that has been organized or processed to make it useful. While data is just raw facts and figures, information helps us understand and make decisions by providing context and meaning.

## What is a Database?

A database is an organized collection of related data. It is designed to allow data to be easily accessed, managed, and updated.

## What is DBMS?

A database is a structured collection of data that is organized in a way that allows easy retrieval, management, and storage of information. It's like an electronic filing system that stores, organizes, and retrieves data efficiently. Databases are used to store a wide variety of information, ranging from simple lists to complex financial records, customer information, and more.
