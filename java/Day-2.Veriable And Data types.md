# Veriable 
Variable is a Container which hold the Memory space.  
Veriable also has memory address.
```
  int a; // Variable Declaration
  a = 10; // Variable initializing
  int b = 10; // We ca do both at same time  
```
### Role of Variables in Programming
- Data Storage 
- Data Manipulation
- Memory Management
- Control Flow 
- State Management 
- Communication 
  
### Data Types
Data types are used to specify which types of data we are storing in a veriable.  
there are two types of data types in java first is `Premetive data types` and other one is `Non-Primitive data types`.  
```
int a = 10; // int is a data type  
```
#### Primitive data types
- byte: 8-bit signed integer (-128 to 127) `1byte`
- short: 16-bit signed integer (-32,768 to 32,767) `2byte`
- int: 32-bit signed integer (-2^31 to 2^31-1) `4 byte`
- long: 64-bit signed integer (-2^63 to 2^63-1) `8 byte`
- float: 32-bit floating-point number (single-precision) `4 byte`
- double: 64-bit floating-point number (double-precision) `8 byte`
- char: 16-bit Unicode character (0 to 65,535) `2 byte`
- boolean: Represents true or false values `1 bit`

#### Non-Primitive data types
used to store references to objects in memory. These data types don't actually contain the data but instead hold references (memory addresses) to objects.  
- String 
- Array
- Interface
- Class
